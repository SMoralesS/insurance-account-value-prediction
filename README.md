# insurance-account-value-prediction
This repository contains code and resources for building predictive models to estimate account values within the framework of company insurance. The primary goal of this project is to develop accurate machine learning algorithms that can forecast the future account values for insurance policies held by the company.

Key Features:

    Data Processing: Includes scripts and notebooks for cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw insurance data into a suitable format for modeling.
    Model Development: Provides implementations of various machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, ensemble methods, and neural networks, tailored for predicting account values.
    Evaluation Metrics: Includes functions for evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared.
    Documentation: Contains detailed documentation and tutorials explaining the data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection criteria, and interpretation of results.
    Deployment: Offers guidance on deploying trained models into production environments, including considerations for scalability, performance, and maintainability.

Contributing:

Contributions to this repository are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving data preprocessing pipelines, experimenting with new modeling techniques, or enhancing documentation, your contributions can help advance the accuracy and usability of the predictive models developed in this project.
